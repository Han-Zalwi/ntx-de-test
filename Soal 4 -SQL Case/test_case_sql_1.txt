NOTE : 
I used google bigquery for producing this query code and the name of the table that i built is `hardy-device-431214-f8.2002Han.public`. However, You can change it with the table that you have


SQL CODE : 
with rank_country as (
  select *, row_number() over(order by totalTransactionRevenue desc) rank from (
  select country, sum(totalTransactionRevenue) totalTransactionRevenue from `hardy-device-431214-f8.2002Han.public` group by 1)
), top_5_country as (
  select * from rank_country where rank <= 5
), final_pool_data as (
SELECT a.country, channelGrouping, a.totalTransactionRevenue FROM `hardy-device-431214-f8.2002Han.public` a left join top_5_country b on a.country = b.country where b.country is not null) 
select country, channelGrouping, sum(totalTransactionRevenue) from final_pool_data group by 1,2 order by 1,2
